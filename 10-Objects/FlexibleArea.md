# FlexibleArea

### NeTEx annotation: 
***Specialisation of a FLEXIBLE QUAY (which is abstract) to identify what is the catchment area for a flexible service (so that a stop finder can find the nearest available types of transport). It is a named zone visited by a particular mode of transport. It is part of the SITE data set rather than the service data set, since it can be defined and exists independently of an actual service.***
